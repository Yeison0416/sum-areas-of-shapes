# sum-areas-of-shapes
Javascript exercise which consist in sum areas both flat and solid shapes likewise add volumes on solid shapes. Each shape was built through object composition making each of them stand by specific contracts so allowing program extension and avoiding program modifications when new shape (object) is added. Each piece of code was done keeping in mind SOLID principles:

### 1. Single Resposability
### 2. Open Closed
### 3. Liskov Substitution
### 4. Interface Segregation
### 5. Dependency inversion
